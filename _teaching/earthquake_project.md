I've been developing a series of tutorials and Jupyter notebooks that guide you through how to download historical earthquake records and perform spatial and temporal analysis on the data in Python. They are run in Google Colaboratory, so you don't need to have Python installed locally (you just need a Google account).

You can find links to the practicals here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/fclubb/SciRes-Earthquakes).

* Practical 1: loading in the earthquake data and making map plots in Python. [Link here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fclubb/SciRes-Earthquakes/blob/main/Practical_1_map_plotting.ipynb).
* Practical 2: spatial and temporal analysis of historical earthquakes. [Link here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fclubb/SciRes-Earthquakes/blob/main/Practical_2_spatial_temporal_v2.ipynb)
* Practical 3: making magnitude-frequency plots in Python. [Link here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fclubb/SciRes-Earthquakes/blob/main/Practical_3_magnitude_frequency.ipynb)

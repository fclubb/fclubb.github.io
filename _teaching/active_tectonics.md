I teach a lecture series for first year students that explores how active tectonics interact with Earth surface processes to build mountain ranges.

In this video I show how you can model stick and slip behaviour along faults that causes earthquakes at home. The experiment uses a brick, a wooden board and an elastic band and is easy to try yourself!

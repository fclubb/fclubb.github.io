# Earth surface processes and topography

I am a geomorphologist studying the interactions between the shape of Earth's topography, surface processes, tectonics, and climate.  Please see my [Research](/research/index.html) page for details of past, future, and current projects.

A large part of my research is developing open-source software for analysing topographic data. I particularly focus on dealing with high-resolution data derived from lidar point clouds.  Iâ€™ve been developing this software, called LSDTopoTools, along with colleagues at the University of Edinburgh,  University of Glasgow, and Queen Mary University of London. See our [LSDTopoTools website](lsdtopotools.github.io) for more details, or check out our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/LSDtopotools). We have developed lots of novel techniques for analysing topography, such as extracting channel networks, delineating floodplains and river terraces, and calculating hilltop and hillslope metrics.

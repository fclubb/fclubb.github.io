# Earth surface processes and geohazards at Durham University

I am a geomorphologist studying the interactions between the shape of Earth's topography, surface processes, tectonics, and climate.  Please see my [Research](/research/index.html) page for details of past, future, and current projects.

My research involves developing open-source software for analysing topographic data. I particularly focus on dealing with high-resolution data derived from lidar point clouds.  Iâ€™ve been developing this software, called LSDTopoTools, along with colleagues at the University of Edinburgh,  University of Glasgow, and Queen Mary University of London. See our [LSDTopoTools website](lsdtopotools.github.io) for more details, or check out our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/LSDtopotools). We have developed lots of novel techniques for analysing topography, such as extracting channel networks, delineating floodplains and river terraces, automatically measuring valley width, and calculating hilltop and hillslope metrics.

## Opportunities

I'm currently interested in recruiting for PhD and post-doctoral positions in tectonic geomorphology, fluvial geomorphology, geohazards, and topographic analysis. Please get in touch with ideas for potential projects and we can discuss funding opportunities.

### Open postdoctoral positions 

We are currently hiring for a 2-year post-doctoral research associate associated by the NERC and Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences-funded project _"Dynamic Risks for Cascading Himalayan Hazards"_. The PDRA will be focused on quantitative geomorphology and will work on cascading landslide and flood hazards in the Garhwal Himalaya, India. For more details and to apply, please see the job description [here](https://durham.taleo.net/careersection/du_ext/jobdetail.ftl?job=24000714&tz=GMT%2B01%3A00&tzname=Europe%2FLondon). **Closing date: 20th June 2024**

### Post-doctoral fellowships

There are a number of different fellowships which you can apply for to work at Durham University. Please note that all these schemes are competitive and require a strong CV and project idea. I'm happy to help support interested candidates! Potential schemes are:

* Addison Wheeler Fellowships: 3 years funding for early stage researchers who have already achieved a PhD. Deadline is around February each year: [more information](https://www.dur.ac.uk/ias/addisonwheelerfellowships/)
* Newton International Fellowships: 2 years for non-UK researchers who wish to work in the UK: [more information](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/)
* Leverhulme Early Career Fellowships: 3 years funding for early stage researchers: [more information](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships)

### PhD opportunities

Durham University is part of the NERC-funded IAPETUS2 DTP, which has a number of PhD studentships available each year. See the [IAPETUS2 website](http://www.iapetus.ac.uk) for more details of available projects and deadlines.

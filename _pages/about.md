# Earth surface processes and geohazards at Durham University

I am a geomorphologist studying the interactions between the shape of Earth's topography, surface processes, tectonics, and climate.  Please see my [Research](/research/index.html) page for details of past, future, and current projects.

My research involves developing open-source software for analysing topographic data. I particularly focus on dealing with high-resolution data derived from lidar point clouds.  Iâ€™ve been developing this software, called LSDTopoTools, along with colleagues at the University of Edinburgh,  University of Glasgow, and Queen Mary University of London. See our [LSDTopoTools website](lsdtopotools.github.io) for more details, or check out our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/LSDtopotools). We have developed lots of novel techniques for analysing topography, such as extracting channel networks, delineating floodplains and river terraces, automatically measuring valley width, and calculating hilltop and hillslope metrics.

## Opportunities

I'm currently interested in recruiting for PhD and post-doctoral positions in tectonic geomorphology, fluvial geomorphology, geohazards, and topographic analysis. Please get in touch with ideas for potential projects and we can discuss funding opportunities.


### Post-doctoral fellowships

There are a number of different fellowships which you can apply for to work at Durham University. Please note that all these schemes are competitive and require a strong CV and project idea. I'm happy to help support interested candidates! Potential schemes are:

* Addison Wheeler Fellowships: 3 years funding for early stage researchers who have already achieved a PhD. Deadline is around February each year: [more information](https://www.dur.ac.uk/ias/addisonwheelerfellowships/)
* Newton International Fellowships: 2 years for non-UK researchers who wish to work in the UK: [more information](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/)
* Leverhulme Early Career Fellowships: 3 years funding for early stage researchers: [more information](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships)

### PhD opportunities

Durham University is part of the NERC-funded IAPETUS2 DTP, which has a number of PhD studentships available each year. See the [IAPETUS2 website](http://www.iapetus.ac.uk) for more details of available projects and deadlines.
